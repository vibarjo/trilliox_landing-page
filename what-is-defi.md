            <h1>What is DeFi? A Beginner's Guide</h1>
            <p class="post-meta">Published on September 11, 2025</p>

            <p>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is an emerging technology that's revolutionizing the way we think about money and financial services. Unlike traditional banking, which is controlled by central institutions, DeFi is open, transparent, and accessible to everyone.</p>

            <h3>Why is it so important?</h3>
            <p>The core principle of DeFi is decentralization. All transactions and rules are public and verifiable on a blockchain. This eliminates the need for intermediaries like banks, making the process faster and more secure.</p>
            
            <h3>How it Works</h3>
            <p>DeFi applications, often called DApps, are built on top of a blockchain, most commonly Ethereum. These applications use **smart contracts**, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. The smart contract automatically handles transactions and agreements without a third party.</p>

            <p>By removing intermediaries, DeFi makes financial services more efficient and open to anyone with an internet connection. It's a key part of our mission at Genesis Ledger to make this technology easy to understand and use.</p>
